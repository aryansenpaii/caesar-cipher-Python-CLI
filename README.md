# Caesar Cipher CLI Application

This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The application is run entirely in the command line interface.

## How to Use

1. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` file in your Python environment.

2. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to encode or decode a message.

3. If you choose to encode a message:
   - Enter the text you want to encode.
   - Enter the shift number to apply the Caesar Cipher encryption.

4. If you choose to decode a message:
   - Enter the encoded text.
   - Enter the shift number used for encryption.

5. The application will then display the encoded/decoded message.
